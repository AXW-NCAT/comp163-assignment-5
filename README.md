Why you chse each loop type for each challenge?

I chose a while loop for challenge 1 because a user could run this program numerous times. Since the programmer can't determine that specifc number of runs the user will chose to do, a while loop is used so the program can run until the user chooses to stop. I chose to use a for loop for challenge 2 because the arithmatic operation was going to use a predetermined set of numbers to test and see if the user entered value was prime or not. The range of numbers began at 2 and ended with the user entered number minus 1. When completing challenge 3 I used a for loop because the multiplication table was an array of numbers 1-10, so I could use the range function. Also, when I was making the calculations, the products conld only come from the numbers in the range and a for loop did just that. The for loop only took values from the specified range to fill in the table.

How your solutions work?

Challenge 1:
The user enters a number and my program will test if the number was even or not and then create a sequence depending on the result of the test. My solution is a combination of even and odd numbers. If the number was odd it was multiplied by 3 and then raidsed by a value of 1. The solution is a straight line of values with its amount of steps stated underneath.

Challenge 2:

The userer enters a number and then my program tests to see if it's a prime number or not. If it's prime, the program will let you know and vis versa. The test I used was I checkled to see whether the number entered was evenly divisable by numbers ranging from 2 to itself. This was the test I chose because a prime nunmber is only evenly divisable by itself and one. So if the number was evely divisable by any other numnber, it wassn't prime.

Challenge 3:
This solution begins with a row of numbers 1-10. Then for each number in the row, a column was produced with the product of the column number and the row number. The {row:5} code helps with spacing in the table.
