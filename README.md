Why you chse each loop type for each challenge?
I chose a while loop for challenge one because a user could run this program numerous times. Since the programmer can't determine that specifc number a while loo is used so the program to run until the user chooses to stop. I chose to use a for loop for challenge 2 because the arithmatic operation was going to use a predetermined set of numbers to test and see if the userentered valeu was prime or not.
